### Executive Summary

This dissertation demonstrates many of the problematic practices regarding correlation-based educational "research."  While technically competent in its statistical execution, it suffers from fundamental flaws in causal reasoning, weak theoretical foundations, and misleading interpretations.  This 'snake oil' has been pushed out to school boards everywhere.  The tremendous costs in lost time, energy and money to school districts is probably unknown and unknowable.

## Major Issues

### Methodology

- **Proper statistical calculations**: Correctly calculated Pearson correlations with significance testing  

- **Multiple analysis levels**: Examined relationships at Standards, Benchmarks, and Key Indicators levels  

- **Some sample handling**: Distinguished between "all districts" and "quorum districts"  

- **Transparency**: Provided complete statistical appendices and acknowledged limitations (however, see below)


### Practical Relevance

- **Real-world application**: Addresses author's personal concerns about school board effectiveness in raising standardized scores.  No causal evidence provided.  

- **Framework for Action**: BSAS provides specific behavioral guidance for boards, despite repeated disclaimers that 'correlation is not causation.' 

- **Policy implications**: Do to study limitations it should not inform board training and development  

---

## Fundamental Flaws and Biases

### 1. **Correlation ≠ Causation Violations**

Despite repeatedly acknowledging this limitation, Lorentzen consistently violates this principle:

**Explicit Causal Language**:

- "School boards that accomplish the items identified in the BSAS **govern districts with the highest achievement scores**" (Abstract)

- "The actions of school boards **matter**" (p. 113, emphasis added)

- "If student achievement is to continue to improve... all relevant factors **must be identified, employed, and aligned**" (p. 115)

- "Only the school board **can**, and **must**, accomplish certain needs vital to a successful school district" (p. 134)

**Problems**: These statements imply causal mechanisms based purely on correlational data. The study cannot distinguish whether:

- Good boards cause higher achievement

- Higher achievement attracts better board members

- Third variables cause both

- Relationships are entirely spurious

** No attempt to specify and control for confounders (not a DAG to be seen), which might have given him some standing to make causal claims.



### 2. **Confirmation Bias and Motivated Reasoning**

**Pre-determined Conclusions**:
The study appears designed to validate the WSSDA framework rather than test it objectively:

- **Hypothesis formulation**: "The hypothesis... is that there is a relationship" - this isn't a hypothesis, it's an expectation

- **Results interpretation**: Statistically significant correlations are immediately treated as meaningful relationships

- **Non-significant results**: Largely ignored or explained away


**Cherry-picking Evidence**:

- Focuses heavily on the few significant correlations while downplaying that most (>80%) showed no relationship

- Standard deviation findings (board consensus) are presented as "interesting" despite being non-significant



### 3. **Weak Theoretical Foundation**

#### **Absence of Causal Mechanisms**:

The dissertation lacks any coherent theory about **how** board behaviors might influence student achievement:

- No discussion of transmission mechanisms

- No consideration of alternative explanations

- No theoretical framework for why these specific behaviors matter


**Example**:  

How does "committing to a clear and shared purpose" (Key Indicator 6) actually affect what happens in classrooms? The study provides no theoretical pathway.



### 4. **Statistical Fishing and Multiple Testing Issues**

**Massive Multiple Comparisons**:

- **768 total correlations** calculated

- **88 (11.46%) significant at p ≤ .05**

- **No correction for multiple testing**


**Problem**: With 768 comparisons at α = .05, we'd expect ~38 significant results by chance alone. Finding 88 significant results isn't necessarily meaningful without proper statistical correction.


**Post-hoc Theorizing**:

The author essentially data-mined correlations then constructed explanations afterward - classic p-hacking behavior.

---

## Methodological Concerns

### 1. **Sample Size and Power Issues**

**Inadequate Sample**:
- **27 total districts** (22% response rate)
- **11 "quorum" districts** for key analyses
- **Montana only** - severe generalizability limits

**Statistical Power**:
With n=11 for quorum analysis, correlations need to be r > .602 to reach significance. This creates a strong bias toward finding only very large correlations, missing potentially meaningful moderate relationships.

### 2. **Measurement Validity Questions**

**BSAS Instrument**:
- Developed by advocacy organization (WSSDA) with clear agenda
- Factor analysis shows only 58-73% variance explained
- Self-report data from board members (social desirability bias)
- No validation against objective board behavior measures

**Achievement Measure**:
- Single year of data
- 10th grade CRT only
- No consideration of student mobility, demographics, or prior achievement

### 3. **Confounding Variables**

The study acknowledges but doesn't adequately address major confounds:
- **Socioeconomic status**: Wealthy districts likely have both better boards and higher achievement
- **District size/resources**: Larger districts may attract different board members
- **Community characteristics**: Education-oriented communities may produce both engaged boards and achievement pressure
- **Superintendent quality**: High-performing superintendents might both attract good board members and drive achievement

---

## Interpretation Problems

### 1. **Misleading Effect Size Interpretations**

**Correlation Magnitudes**:
Even significant correlations are often modest:
- Many significant r values between .38-.50
- r² values suggest shared variance of only 15-25%
- Yet these are presented as meaningful "relationships"

**Standard Deviation Analysis**:
The finding that board disagreement correlates with lower achievement (r = -.47 for science, non-significant) is presented as evidence that "student achievement was depressed in those districts where board members held disparate opinions."

**Problem**: This could equally suggest that struggling districts create board conflict, not that conflict causes poor achievement.

### 2. **Practical Significance Inflation**

**Weak Correlations Presented as Important**:
Correlations around .40 are described as "moderate" relationships warranting policy changes, despite explaining only ~16% of variance.

**Missing Context**:
No comparison to effect sizes of other educational interventions or acknowledgment that board effects (if real) appear quite small compared to teacher, student, and family factors.

## Broader Issues with Educational "Research"

This dissertation exemplifies several problems you've identified:

### 1. **PhD Candidate Motivation**
The author explicitly states this study was motivated by 20+ years of board service and desire to "make a difference" - exactly the confirmation bias you described.

### 2. **Advocacy Disguised as Science**
The study uses scientific language and methods to advocate for a predetermined position (boards matter) rather than genuinely test hypotheses.

### 3. **Policy Overreach**
Modest correlational findings are immediately translated into policy recommendations without adequate evidence of causation or effectiveness.

### 4. **Missing Humility**
Despite acknowledged limitations, conclusions are stated with inappropriate confidence and certainty.

---

## What the Data Actually Shows

### Honest Interpretation:
1. **Most board behaviors show no relationship** with achievement (>80% of correlations non-significant)
2. **A few board behaviors correlate weakly** with achievement in this small Montana sample
3. **Alternative explanations** (reverse causation, confounding) are equally plausible
4. **Effect sizes are small** compared to known educational factors
5. **Generalizability is questionable** beyond rural Montana districts

### More Appropriate Conclusions:
- "Some board behaviors show modest correlational relationships with achievement in this limited sample"
- "These findings warrant further investigation but do not establish causal relationships"
- "Board effects, if real, appear small relative to other educational factors"
- "Alternative explanations including reverse causation cannot be ruled out"

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

### If This Were Genuine Scientific Inquiry:

1. **Develop Theoretical Framework**: Specify mechanisms by which board behaviors might influence achievement
2. **Control for Confounds**: Account for SES, district characteristics, superintendent quality
3. **Longitudinal Design**: Track changes in board behavior and achievement over time
4. **Multiple Measures**: Use objective board behavior measures, not just self-reports
5. **Replication**: Test findings across multiple states and contexts
6. **Effect Size Context**: Compare board effects to other educational interventions

### Better Research Questions:
- Under what conditions do board behaviors matter most?
- How do board effects interact with other district factors?
- What mechanisms mediate board influence on achievement?
- Do board effects vary by district characteristics?

## Final Assessment

This dissertation represents **correlation hunting disguised as scientific research**. While technically competent in execution, it fundamentally misrepresents what correlational data can tell us and makes causal claims unsupported by the evidence.

The author's 20+ years of board experience created confirmation bias that led to:
- Predetermined conclusions
- Selective interpretation of results
- Causal language inappropriate for correlational data
- Policy recommendations based on weak evidence

This exemplifies your point about education PhD programs producing advocacy rather than genuine scientific inquiry. The work serves to legitimize pre-existing beliefs about board importance rather than genuinely test hypotheses about educational improvement.

**Bottom Line**: This study tells us more about the author's beliefs than about actual relationships between board behavior and student achievement. It's a sophisticated exercise in confirming what the researcher already believed rather than discovering new knowledge.

Red Flags for Scientific Integrity
1. Data Destruction Promise
Stating upfront that raw data will be destroyed prevents:

Replication attempts
Alternative analyses
Verification of reported results
Detection of analytical errors

2. No Replication Materials
A legitimate scientific study would provide:

De-identified dataset
Analysis code/syntax
Detailed methodology for reproducing results

3. Convenience for the Author
Data destruction eliminates the possibility of:

Other researchers finding different patterns
Discovering analytical mistakes
Testing alternative hypotheses
Checking for data manipulation
*The fact that this passed dissertation defense reflects broader problems with educational research standards and the willingness to accept correlation-based advocacy as legitimate scientific inquiry.*
